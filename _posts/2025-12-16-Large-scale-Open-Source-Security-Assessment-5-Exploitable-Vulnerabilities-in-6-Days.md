1\. **Project Background and Objectives**

[ZAST.AI](https://zast.ai) conducted a comprehensive security assessment for a global technology company headquartered in San Francisco, which operates in over 70 countries, serves more than 10,000 cities, and generates annual revenue exceeding \$40 billion. The primary goal was to evaluate the security of their open-source codebase and component dependencies, aiming to identify potential security risks that could impact both their public repositories and internal systems.

2\. **Assessment Scope and Technical Architecture**

Our assessment encompassed 65 GitHub open-source projects, including 38 JavaScript/TypeScript projects, 22 Java projects, and others written in Go, Python, and Rust. Additionally, we analyzed 261 component libraries (75 NPM packages and 186 Maven packages). Using AI-assisted classification, we categorized these targets into web applications, CLI tools, and component libraries, ultimately creating 226 effective assessment tasks.

3\. **Technical Assessment Methodology**

We developed a comprehensive automated assessment framework to address a core pain point in security assessment: the automated deployment of target applications. Traditional approaches often require extensive manual intervention for environment setup and configuration, making large-scale automated security assessment particularly challenging in practice.Among the 65 GitHub projects assessed, we identified and attempted to deploy 6 web applications, with 5 successful deployments and only one failing due to complex runtime dependencies. This success was achieved through our integrated approach combining:

- Static analysis for initial vulnerability pattern detection

- Dynamic testing with automated environment setup

- AI semantic understanding for context-aware analysis

- Automated PoC generation and verification pipeline

4\. **Critical Security Vulnerability Analysis**

**Web Application Security Risks**

During our web application assessment, we identified multiple high-risk Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities primarily stemmed from unfiltered user input being directly used in network requests. In real-world scenarios, attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to access internal services, retrieve metadata, or probe internal network architecture. For example:


```javascript
function getChecksums(req, res) {    
    var client = new TChannel({        
        host: '127.0.0.1',        
        port: 31888    
    });      
    
    client.send({host: req.query.ip}, '/admin/stats', null, null, function(err, res1, res2) {        
        if(err) {            
            res.send(err.message);        
        }    
    ...     
    });
}
```

**CLI Tool Vulnerabilities**

Our analysis of command-line tools revealed two critical types of vulnerabilities: command injection and template injection. These security issues arose from improper handling of user inputs, allowing attackers to potentially inject malicious commands or template syntax for arbitrary code execution. In a typical attack scenario, this could lead to complete system compromise through specially crafted input parameters. For example:


```javascript
var childProcess = require('child_process');
function exec(cmd, opts, cb) {    
    if (typeof opts === 'function') {        
        cb = opts;        
        opts = {};    
    }    
    opts = opts || {};    
    opts.maxBuffer = opts.maxBuffer || 2000 * 1024;      childProcess.exec(cmd, opts, function (err, stdout, stderr) {        
        if (err) {            
            return cb(err);        
            }        
        if (stderr && !opts.silent) {            
            return cb(new Error(stderr));        
        }        
        cb(null, stdout);    
    });
}
module.exports = exec;
```

**Component-Level Security Issues**

In our component library analysis, we identified SSRF-sink and XXE-sink security issues. While these vulnerabilities may not be directly exploitable at the component level, they pose potential security risks when integrated into larger applications. Our AI-powered semantic analysis specifically identified these sink points by analyzing method call chains and parameter passing patterns, enabling early detection of potential security risks.

5\. **Technical Challenges and Solutions**

The large-scale assessment presented several significant technical challenges that required targeted solutions:

**Assessment Scalability**

- Parallel processing of multiple projects

- Automated triage and prioritization

- Real-time progress monitoring and adjustment

**Quality Control**

- False positive elimination through AI verification

- Impact analysis automation

- Cross-validation of findings

**Resource Optimization**

- Dynamic resource allocation

- Automated error recovery

- Performance optimization

These systematic solutions enabled [ZAST.AI](https://zast.ai) to complete the entire assessment of 226 targets within 6 days while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. This approach enabled efficient handling of complex projects with minimal manual intervention.

6\. **Technical Practice Summary and Future Outlook**

This assessment successfully identified 5 directly exploitable vulnerabilities and 3 component-level security issues, helping the target company elevate its security baseline. The practice of large-scale automated security assessment has provided actionable insights for the future development of AI-assisted security analysis.

7\. **Action Plans and Implementation**

Based on the assessment findings, the following security enhancement initiatives have been launched:

**Continuous Assessment Mechanism**

- Established quarterly security assessment for critical components

- Integrated automated security testing into CI/CD pipeline

**Development Process Enhancement**

- Added automated security gates for code submission

- Introduced pre-commit hooks for basic security checks

- Established rapid response mechanism for security defects

**Security Capability Building**

- Conducted targeted secure coding training

- Developed component security usage guidelines

- Created secure coding best practices knowledge base

8\. **Conclusion**

This assessment demonstrates the effectiveness of [ZAST.AI](https://zast.ai)'s integrated solution combining automated tools with AI-assisted analysis in modern security assessments. The reduced assessment time from 3–6 months to 6 days while maintaining high accuracy validates the effectiveness of AI-powered security assessment.
